// CP - Write a program that takes the base and height in cm to find the area of
// a triangle in square inches
// and square centimeters
// Hint => Area of a Triangle is Â½ * base * height and 1 in = 2.54 cm
// I/P => base, height
// O/P => The Area of the triangle in sq in is ___ and sq cm is ___
