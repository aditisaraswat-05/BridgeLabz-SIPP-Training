// Movie Time: Theater Show Listings
// Story: A movie theater allows users to sort upcoming showtimes. Since shows
// are added throughout the day and the existing list is almost sorted, the app
// uses insertion sort to insert each new show in the correct time slot.
// concepts involved:
// - insertion sort
// - real time insertion
// - time based ordering
